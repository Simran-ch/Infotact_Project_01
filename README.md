## Infotact_Project_01
#### Design and develop an intelligent task management system that leverages NLP and ML techniques to automatically classify, prioritize, and assign tasks to users based on their behavior, deadlines, and workloads.

### Week 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing
<br>

**--Objective--**

<br>

The goal for Week 1 was to load the raw task dataset, clean it, enrich it with synthetic values (like deadlines and workloads), and prepare it for downstream machine learning tasks. This included:
<br>

:) Loading the dataset from Google Drive.
<br>

:) Removing duplicates and handling missing values.
<br>

:) Assigning synthetic deadlines and workloads.
<br>

:) Generating task priorities based on deadlines and workloads.
<br>

:) Automatically assigning users based on skill matching.
<br>

:) Preprocessing task descriptions using NLP techniques.
<br>

:) Saving the final cleaned dataset for future use.
